    "In general, Computational Reverse Engineering Analysis for Scattering Experiments (CREASE) is a two step approach that combines a genetic algorithm (GA) as the first step with molecular simulations based reconstruction as the second step to determine for a given input scattering profile the structural features of assembled structures in macromolecular solutions. Structural features range from aggregate dimensions to the chain- and monomer- level packing within the aggregate. This tutorial presents CREASE for vesicles. If you use CREASE in your work, we ask that you please cite one of the relevant papers below. If you use this vesicle code, please cite References 5. \n",

    "This notebook presents a tutorial on how the first step of CREASE, the GA step, works to determine the structural features of the assembled structure (vesicle in this tutorial) found in macromolecular solutions from small angle scattering intensity profiles, I(q)s. The GA codes takes as input an I(q) and finds the structural dimensions of the vesicle whose computed scattering, 𝐼𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝(q), best matches the input I(q). The GA code presented here is applicable to a vesicle structure with an empty (solvent filled) core and three layers (two solvophilic layers and one solvophobic layer). But it can be adapted to other shapes and geometries by modifying sections of the code that will be highlighted as such.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GA code for vesicles is able to determine:\n",
    "1. Vesicle dimensions: the core radius ($R_{core}$), the inner solvophilic A layer thickness ($t_{Ain}$), the middle solvophobic B layer thickness ($t_{B}$), and the outer solvophilic A layer thickness ($t_{Aout}$) \n",
    "2. How the solvophilic scatterers are split between inner ($s_{Ain}$) and outer ($1-s_{Ain}$) layers.\n",

    "Let's start with the initial arguments that the user needs to choose and input for their system. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell block below, the user needs to define the arguments that define the basic architecture of the genetic algorithm:\n",
    "* number of individuals in a population ('pop_number')\n",
    "* number of generations that GA runs for ('generations')\n",
    "* number of binary digits used to represent each individual ('nloci')\n",
    "\n",
    "The user chooses the above three agruments to run the GA. The choice of these three arguments will significantly affect the performance of the GA. We recommend that the user test out different combinations of these three parameters to ensure convergence to the right output. For the vesicle example, after multiple tests during our previous work, we recommend the following values for these arguments to produce reliable output for the input $I$(q):\n",
    "* `pop_number = 80`\n",
    "* `generations = 100`\n",
    "* `nloci = 7`\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the computational time needed to complete the GA run increases with increasing number of individuals and generations, for the purpose of completing this tutorial within reasonable time on a laptop or desktop, we use the following values:\n",
    "* `pop_number = 5`\n",
    "* `generations = 5`\n",
    "* `nloci = 7`\n",
    "\n",
    "You should not expect to see the 'best' 𝐼𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝(q) match the input or target $I$(q) with these settings. With a larger number of individuals and generations, you can see how the GA predictions evolve over the generations to higher \"fitness\" structures [i.e. closer match to the input $I$(q)].\n",
    "\n",
    "For each individual in the GA, we store information about structural features as genes in its genome. For each of the individual's genes, the information is encoded as a seven-digit (chosen by the user as $n_{loci}$, set in this tutorial as 7) binary sequence that corresponds to the value of structural dimensions evenly distributed between the maximum and minimum bounds set by the user (minimum bound will be 0000000, and maximum 1111111). The choice of the number of binary digits will determine the precision of the final optimized structural dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*You may ask at this point - why are we encoding the parameters in a binary fashion?*\n",
    "That is a great question! Actually, whether to use binary or decimal encoding has always been a topic of debate in the field of genetic algorithm. Traditional GAs tend to use binary coding (referred to as 'binary-coded GA'), but there also have been numerous applications of GA to engineering problems using \"decimal coding\" (often referred to as 'real-coded GA'). We developed the algorithm following the binary coding route, but there is technically no reason why one cannot use real-coded GA for this problem. One can always rewrite our genetic operator algorithms if one wishes to use real-coded GA (more on this later)"

In this example, we load in the `vesicle` shape, which requires the following 7 shape descriptors (specified as a list given in the following order with the `shape_params` argument):\n",
    "* Number of scatterers per chain (${num}_{scatterers}$)\n",

    "For vesicles assembled from amphiphilic macromolecules with solvophilic A and solvophobic B blocks, two types of scatterers (A and B, respectively) are randomly placed within the designated vesicle layer boundaries (more details to be given later). The ratio of A and B scatterers matches the composition of the amphiphilic macromolecule ( 1−𝑓𝑏 ,  𝑓𝑏 ).  We note that the scatterers could be point scatterers or scatterers with a specified diameter, as is the case in this example (for reasons described in the reference [5]). Regardless of the choice, the total number of A and B scatterers is another choice that the user has to make to balance the accuracy of the output vesicle dimensions from GA and the computational time for the 𝐼𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝(q) calculation (more details to be given later).\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: The determination of 𝐼𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝(q) in the GA only uses the scatterer placements and these placements do NOT include any connectivity to resemble macromolecules [i.e. no polymer chains are placed].\n",
    "\n",
    "In this vesicle example, the user can enter the macromolecular information about the solution that was used to obtain the scattering profile to guide the choice of number of scatterers placed in the individual candidate structure. Here for this tutorial example, we use the molecular information for a diblock copolymer with the solvophilic block A and solvophobic block B forming the vesicle bilayer. The diblock chain has total number of  𝑁 monomer beads with  𝑓𝑏  fraction of the beads in the chain being solvophobic. The number density of the solvophobic monomor beads in the middle layer is given by $\\rho_B$ and the diameters of the A an B beads (or \"monomer contour length\") are given by $l_{mono,a}$ and $l_{mono,b}$, respectively. The specific values used in this example are given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this vesicle system example, we calculate each individual's 𝐼𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝(q) using seven different replicates/configurations (`nLP`) of random scatterer placements to generate the averaged 𝐼𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝(q) for that individual. Having multiple configurations of scatterer placements mitigates the chance that one configuration of scatterer placements biases the computed scattering intensity. One could also choose to replace the use of multiple (`nLP=7` in this case) placements of fewer scatterers with just one placement using a significantly higher total number of scatterers per unit volume (i.e., scatterer density) leading to a reduced bias compared to using fewer scatterers (or smaller scatterer density). We choose to use multiple different configurations of random scatterer placements in this case to incorporate the ability to capture dispersity in dimensions (more details will be found later). We also note that the calculation of 𝐼𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝(q) scales quadratically with the number of scatterers used, providing another reason for multiple replicates.\n",

    "**Setting bounds for GA parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "The user also sets the maximum (`maxvalu`) and minimum (`minvalu`) bounds for each parameter (or gene) of the individual candidate structure. For the vesicle system example, the GA determines the following parameters:\n",
    "* Core radius ($R_{core}$) \n",
    "* Three individual layer thicknesses in the bilayer consisting of the inner solvophilic A layer ($t_{Ain}$), middle solvophobic B layer ($t_{B}$), and the outer solvophilic A layer ($t_{Aout}$) \n",
    "* Split of the solvophilic scatterers between inner ($s_{Ain}$) and outer layers\n",
    "* Dispersity in the core radius dimension ($\\sigma_{R}$)\n",
    "* Background intensity as -log10($bg$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The structural parameters (core radius and the three layer thicknesses) in the `vesicle` shape are coded in Angstroms, and `q` is given in $A^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to reiterate, different shapes will have different sets of shape descriptors and parameters, so the aforementioned list of descriptors and their definitions only applies to the **`vesicle`** shape. It is important for the user to make sure that the shape descriptors and minimum/maximum bounds correspond to the expectation of the chosen shape.\n"

If the error associated with each q is known, $\\chi^{2}$ can similarly be implemented into the fitness function in CREASE to account for uncertainty in I(q) at each q.

Each shape will have its own `converttoIQ` that takes as input a list of q values (`qrange`) and a list of shape-specific parameters (the \"gene\"), and outputs a list of $I_{comp}$(q) value corresponding to the input `qrange`.

    "**Figure 1**: *CREASE analysis on an example vesicle with the target dimensions of small core with thin B layer (shown schematically). $I_{comp}$(q) of the best individual (colored lines) from all generations in one example GA run (with dispersity) compared with the input in silico  $I_{exp}$(q) (open circles). Progression from the initial generation to the final generation is shown with increasingly warmer colors.*\n",

    "From the best individual's $I_{comp}$(q) over multiple generations, we can see that increasing the population size and number of generation gradually drives the GA determined vesicle structure toward that of the target structure (**Figure 1**). Because our input  $I_{exp}$(q) was generated in silico from known target dimensions, we can also make a direct comparison of the GA determined vesicle dimensions to the known target dimensions. For comparison we also provide the dimensions determined through the traditional fitting of the data with the core-multi-shell model in SASVIEW.\n",

    "**Figure 2**: *GA determined dimensions of relevant vesicle features at the end of 100 generations for the cases where dispersity in dimensions is not accounted for in the GA step (blue triangles) and when dispersity is incorporated into the GA (orange squares). The target dimensions of the in silico Iexp(q) are shown as open circles with 20% dispersity in the core radius (Rcore) dimensions. SASVIEW fitting results using the core-multi-shell model (grey stars) are offset to the right of the target dimensions.*\n",

    "As discussed during the tutorial, GA for vesicles can incorporate the effect of dispersity in the dimensions of the assembly into the calculation of the individual's $I_{comp}$(q). This dispersity is determined as one of the GA results given as $\\sigma_{R}$ in this example systems where dispersity is incorporated in the core radius dimension. **Figure 2** shows how the GA with (i.e. GA searches and optimizes for $\\sigma_{R}$) and without (i.e. GA sets $\\sigma_{R} = 0$) dispersity performs in getting the vesicle structural dimensions of core radius ($R_{core}$), each layer thickness ($t_{A,in}$, $t_{B}$, $t_{A,out}$) and total vesicle diameter size ($D_{vesicle}$). We can see that with an appropriate population size and number of generations, the GA is able to accurately capture the target structure's dimensions. Additionally, while the analytical fitting to a core-multi-shell model using SASVIEW can also determine these structural dimensions, GA for vesicle is able to inform the user how the molecules are split between the inner and outer layers of the vesicle wall ($s_{Ain}$), a piece of molecular information not available if the core-multi-shell model is used instead. The GA determined parameter $s_{Ain}$ gives the fraction of molecules in the vesicle assembly that occupies the inner layer of the vesicle walls. For this example system, the target structure has 20% of the molecules in the assembly occupying the inner layer of the vesicle wall and the GA is able to determine $s_{Ain}$ as 28%, matching the target value.\n",
